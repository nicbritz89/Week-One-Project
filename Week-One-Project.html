    <h2> About Nic</h2>
   
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
       <h4> Sport</h4>
       <p>I have a passion for playing sport and being competitive. The feeling of being able to train and improve oneself.</p>
       <h5>Cricket</h5>
       <p>The first sport I fell in love with. It gets played during my favourite season which is summer. My favourite team is the Proteas who have inspired me and broken my heart.</p>
       <h5>Bowls</h5>
       <p>The sport I took up when I came back from Russia. It was the one sport my dad and I could play together. My fondest memory was playing against him in the club pairs competition.</p>
       
       <h3> Work</h3>
       <p>Quite a colourful and broad career</p>
       <h4>Pick n Pay</h4>
       <p>Very interesting working at store level and learning the basics of how a store and business operates. Learning how systems work and the importance of them.</p>
       <h4>Coaching</h4>
       <p>Testing yourself to improve the performance of your players. Getting them to improve 10% and keep them motivated to play.</p>
       <h4>GPCC</h4>
       <p>My dream job. Running GPCC and making GPCC great again with my Father. The three best working years of my life and making special projects happen. </p>
       <h4>Let's Talk Boules</h4>
       <p>Truly a privilege to work and learn from Byron.</p>
       <h4>Denis School</h4>
       <p> I really enjoy my classes and being creative to ensure the students learn and are entertained.</p>
       <h4>Hamilton Juniors</h4>
       <p>Such an honour when Adrian asked me to get involved with Hammies Juniors. He has the recipe to create professional rugby players.</p>
       
       <h3> Travels</h3>
       <p>Due to my passion for sport it has lead me to wonderful places with interesting histories.  </p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow" style="text-decoration:none ;"> <h4>Moscow</h4>   </a>
       <p> I contacted Cricket Russia to take up a coaching postion in 2013 after I obtained my level 1 coaching certificate. Truly amazing moment standing on Red Square and gazing at the Kremlin, St Basil's Cathedral and realising the importance this area played in world history. A memorable moment was having a Brandy and Coke at the British Embassy overlooking the Moscow River.  </p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" style="text-decoration:none ;"> <h4>London</h4>  </a>
       <p> I went to visit my cousin in the UK and stayed with his family for a weekend</p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome" style="text-decoration:none ;"> <h4>Rome</h4>  </a>
       <a> I had to go to Rome to fetch a Russian Visa on my Italian passport. Walked around Rome and saw famous sites. Visited the Colloseum, Trevi Fountain and Partheon. Met up with the Father of Italian Cricket. Stayed at Camp Tiber where I met interesting people.  </a>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence" style="text-decoration:none ;"> <h4>Florence</h4>  </a>
       <p>On a weekend away with my fiance we travelled to the beautiful city of Fiorentina. The fashion, the architecture, the history, the culture and fashion was breath taking. On the way back we visited Bergamo and danced in the street at midnight which was unforgettable.</p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa" style="text-decoration:none ;"> <h4>Goa</h4> </a>
       <p> Part of my first tour with the Russian national cricket team we partook in the Goa Proffessional League. A league setup to make up for Goa not having an IPL team. It was a dream come true to play a match under lights, broadcast on television in front of 8000 people was a highlight.  </p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest" style="text-decoration:none ;"> <h4>Bucharest</h4>   </a>
       <p> My second tour with the national team. We played in the 2018 Continental Cup in Romania. We were looking to win the tournament but preparation leading up to the tournament was poor and we lost to Romania and Bulgaria after such a strong start. We bowled Turkey out for 14 and I took 4 wickets. Twice I was on a hatrick.</p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam" style="text-decoration:none ;"> <h4>Amsterdam</h4></a>
       <p> I was part of the grand prize winner Emilio who went to Amsterdam for the weekend to go watch Ajax Amsterdam play against PSV at the Amsterdam Arena. The atmosphere was enthralling and Ajax won the game. We went on a tour of De Toekomst and met Thulani Serero and other Amsterdam players. </p> 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg" style="text-decoration:none ;"> <h4>St Petersburg</h4></a>
      <p> Another highlight with my fiance was going to St Petersburg during the white nights to view the bridges raise at the same time at 00H00. To see soo many boats on the water was such a tremendous occasion. </p>
